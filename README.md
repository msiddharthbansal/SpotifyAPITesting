I have successfully performed testing of Searching for a Song and Fetching Album Details using Spotify Web API.

*Please Note: The authorization code for the API depends on the Client ID and Client Secret which are provided by the Developer Environment of Spotify.

I have used GoogleTest for testing and Curl software for my problem.

Above is the result of the testing. The result indicate the following conclusions:

1. In total 2 tests from 1 test suite were running
2. 1 test: Searching for a Song by Name took 474 ms.
3. 1 test: Fetching Album Details took 293 ms.

Overall, the whole program took 768 ms in total and all tests ran "successfully".

Further into the problem, I am thinking to to Create, Update and Delete playlist using the Spotify API.
